Problem Statement

Evaluating one-word and multiple-choice answers manually is repetitive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Teachers often face difficulties in maintaining both speed and accuracy when handling a large volume of student responses. This process is further complicated by inconsistencies and human errors, which can affect the fairness of grading. Additionally, variations in students' handwriting make it challenging for traditional systems to accurately recognize one-word answers. As a result, there is a growing need for an automated system that can reduce manual effort while ensuring fair and accurate assessment of both written and marked responses.


Objectives

To create an AI-powered app that helps teachers quickly and fairly evaluate handwritten student answers even when the writing is messy so they can focus more on teaching and less on manual correction.

To read handwritten one-word answers using ocr and to check multiple choice answers using omr.

To use AI to help make sense of messy handwriting especially in situations like student answer sheets so that even if someone’s writing isn’t perfect, their ideas can still be understood and evaluated fairly.

To help educators quickly generate accurate student reports, making evaluation faster and feedback more meaningful.
