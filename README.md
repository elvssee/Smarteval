Problem Statement

Evaluating one-word and multiple-choice answers manually is repetitive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Teachers often face difficulties in maintaining both speed and accuracy when handling a large volume of student responses. This process is further complicated by inconsistencies and human errors, which can affect the fairness of grading. Additionally, variations in students' handwriting make it challenging for traditional systems to accurately recognize one-word answers. As a result, there is a growing need for an automated system that can reduce manual effort while ensuring fair and accurate assessment of both written and marked responses.


Objectives

1. To create a mobile app that helps teachers check student answers more easily.

2. To read handwritten one-word answers using ocr and to check multiple choice answers using omr.

3. To use AI to understand and evaluate unclear or messy handwriting.

4. To quickly generate result reports for students.

5. To save time and reduce mistakes in the answer-checking process.
